# j_cookie

Juli's base cookiecutter-django project.

[![Built with Cookiecutter Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Cookiecutter%20Django-ff69b4.svg?logo=cookiecutter)](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django/)

This project was created to learn about creating a project in cookiecutter-django with docker.  The capstone project I am working on with a team is to modernize the STOQS development environment by porting the existing code base into a new project, a dockerized cookiecutter-django web application.  Since I have not worked with django, cookiecutter, or docker, the first milestone was to learn the development stack.  This repo documents what I have learned in my first milestone.

## Have the following installed:
* Python (I had 3.9.13 installed)
* Cookiecutter (this needed for cookiecutter-django)

      pip install cookiecutter
      
* Docker Desktop

      ```

9. Project is now created.  Follow instructions on how to build and run the program.

---


## After project has been created, each time you want to run the project do the following:

1. You can either use terminal or VSC's terminal.  Start virtual environment.  Also, start Docker Desktop.

2. Build project:

      ```
      docker-compose -f local.yml build
      ```

3. Run project:

      ```
      docker-compose -f local.yml up
      ```

4. Open browser and go to localhost port 8000 to view project:

      ```
      http://127.0.0.1:8000
      ```

      or

      ```
      localhost:8000
      ```

5. When closing the project.  In the terminal the project is running, press CONTROL-C to stop the program.  Then stop the virtual environment by typing:

      ```
      deactivate
      ```
